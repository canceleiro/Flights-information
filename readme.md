# Flight Delays analysis
## by Javier Alonso Alonso

This notebook analyzes data provided by Kaggle ( https://www.kaggle.com/usdot/flight-delays/data) of data from all flights in the US in 2015 and we´ve tried to analyze the delays and the causes of them. In Udacity I had an uncomplete dataset of the flight with less flights and it didn´t have flights from October so I´ve used the one in Kaggle

I´ve done the ETL in Jupyter Notebook placed in https://github.com/canceleiro/Flights-information

We´ve done the EDA in Tableau:

- Per month: https://public.tableau.com/profile/javier.alonso#!/vizhome/Flight_Analysis_15854722426730/permonth
- Per airline: https://public.tableau.com/profile/javier.alonso#!/vizhome/Flight_Analysis_15854722426730/perairline
- Per origin dashboard: https://public.tableau.com/profile/javier.alonso#!/vizhome/Flight_Analysis_15854722426730/Origin
- Per destination dashboard: https://public.tableau.com/profile/javier.alonso#!/vizhome/Flight_Analysis_15854722426730/Destination
